MeArm Arduino uses standard data formats and protocols to enable it to be controlled from any programming language, including directly from the browser. Here's how it works...

High Level Protocol Description
===============================
All communication with the MeArm Arduino is done by sending and receiving JSON packets over a WebSocket. Because MeArm Arduino is asynchronous (i.e. it doesn't execute a command immediately) there can be multiple responses to a message that is sent. It can also broadcast notifications for events such as bumping into an obstacle. The JSON message from the client to Mirobot has three parameters:

 - cmd : the command to be executed
 - arg : any arguments to the command
 - id : a string that is used to identify which command a response is for

A response from Mirobot has the following parameter:

 - status : a word describing the status for the command that was sent, e.g. complete
 - msg : a descriptive piece of text or piece of data
 - id : the id of the message that this response is for

For example:

    {"cmd":"forward", "arg":100, "id":"abc123"}

will tell Mirobot to move forward by 100mm. When this is sent, Mirobot will immediately respond with a message saying that this command has been accepted:

    {"status":"accepted", "id":"abc123"}

and once the command has completed, another response will be transmitted

    {"status":"complete", "id":"abc123"}

There are two types of commands that can be sent to Mirobot"
 - short commands which complete immediately
 - long commands which complete after a period of time. There can only be one of these running at a time.

Short commands can be sent at any time, regardless of other commands being sent. If you try to send a long command before another long command has completed you will receive an error response:

    {"status":"error", "msg":"Previous command not finished", "id":"abc321"}

Other errors include sending a command which is not recognised:

    {"status":"error", "msg":"Command not recognised", "id":"abc321"}

or sending badly formed JSON:

    {"status":"error", "msg":"JSON parse error", "id":"abc321"}


Notifications
=============

If you enable notifications for a particular event you will receive occasional messages when the event happens. For example, if you enable notifications for collision, you will receive notification messages which look like this:

    {"status":"notify", "msg":"left", "id":"collide"}

Because this notification is not in response to a particular message that you sent, the id is set to the id of the event that occurred, in this case "collide".

    {"status":"complete", "id":"54321"}


Collide
------------
Enables built-in collision detection. To stop, send the "stop" command.

    {"cmd":"collide", "id":"54321"}

response:

    {"status":"complete", "id":"54321"}


CollideState
------------

response:

    {"status":"complete", "id":"54321"}

Once enabled, notifications will be emitted when the value as described above changes. This can result in quite a lot of messages and this is quite normal.

    {"cmd":"slackCalibration", "arg":12, "id":"54321"}

response:

    {"status":"complete", "id":"54321"}
