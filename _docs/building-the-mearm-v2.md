If your MeArm pack contains elastic bands, then these are the instructions for you. If it does not contain elastic bands, check out the [MeArm V1]() or [MeArm V3](http://learn.mearm.com/docs/building-the-mearm-v3/) instructions.

This video shows the whole build process. 

You might need to calibrate your servo motors before building the MeArm. This technique and other specific set up instructions can be found in the following tutorials:

 - [MeArm Robot for micro:bit kit](/docs/mearm-microbit-setup)
 - [MeArm Robot for Raspberry Pi](/docs/getting-started-with-the-mearm-pi)
 - [MeArm Robot Arduino Compatible kit](/docs/mearm-microbit-setup)
 - MeArm Robot Classic Maker Kit - this kit requires you to provide your own controller. See our main category for examples.

## Tips for success:
 - Don't overtighten the screws! Tightening them too much can damage the arm. The best way of tightening the screws is to screw them in until they stop the joint moving freely and then loosen them slightly until it moves with no friction.

 - Don't force any of the pieces into position. If something won't fit then it's probably not meant to. If a part is meant to go on a specific way around then it has been designed to only go on that way around. If it doesn't seem to fit correctly then try turning it around.
