The parts
---------

This is an easy one! All you need is this small speaker:

![The parts](/assets/docs/using-sound-v1/01.jpg)


Step one
--------

Plug it in to the two pins on the main PCB marked "sound". It can go either way around, it doesn't matter.

Step two
--------
Peel off the ring of paper and stick the speaker on to the base of the chassis. This will make it reverberate more and be louder.

Step three
----------

Now you can use the function in the web UI called "Beep" and hear Mirobot express itself using sound. You may need to [update](/docs/update-firmware-v1/) the UI firmware in order to do this.
