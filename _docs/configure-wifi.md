Mirobot uses WiFi to communicate, which means the first thing you need to do to use it is to set up its WiFi connection. The first thing you'll need to do is to access the built-in web interface:

 - Turn it on. The second red LED should start flashing and should then stay on
 - Once it has stopped flashing you should be able to connect to the open wireless network called "mirobot"
 - Once you have connected to the "mirobot" WiFi network, visit [http://10.10.100.254](http://10.10.100.254) and you should see the mirobot interface loading in your browser

Get it on your network
----------------------

Once you've been able to use Mirobot via the built-in interface, the next step is to get it on your network so you can use the [apps](http://apps.mirobot.io):

 - Click on the "Configure WiFi" link in the top right of the page

 - Click the "Save" button and Mirobot will restart
 - After 20 seconds, reload your browser and it should say "WiFi Connected" instead
 - To find out what its IP address is, you can click on the "WiFi Connected" link again and see it there
 - Now you should join your computer to your existing network again and access Mirobot via this IP address
