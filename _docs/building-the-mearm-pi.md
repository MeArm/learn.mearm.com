    title: Fit the servo into the Base PCB
    description: Take the base PCB and place it face up (look for the word TOP to help) then insert the servo that has a double ended arm (there's only one of these) into the hole in the centre. It needs to go the right way around so align the servo arm with the circle on the board
  - time: 2.35
    title: Fit the centre piece over the servo
    description: Find the centre piece (number x) and slide it down over the servo. The tabs are sized so it will only go on one way so if it doesn't go on easily, try it the other way around
  - time: 4.0
    title: Keep the cable tidy
    description: Wind the servo cable around the centre piece to keep it tidy. Looking from above it should be wound in a clockwise direction through the two holes on each side of the servo
  - time: 5.9
    title: Add the base ends
    description: Slide the end pieces down over the centre piece so that they slot into the base. Again, these will only go on one way around
