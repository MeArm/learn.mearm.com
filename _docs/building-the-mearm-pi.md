    title: Fit the servo into the Base PCB
    description: "Take the base PCB and place it face up (look for the word TOP to help) then insert the servo that has a double ended arm (there's only one of these) into the hole in the centre. It needs to go the right way around so align the servo arm with the circle on the board"
  - time: 2.35
    title: Fit the centre piece over the servo
    description: "Find the centre piece (part #1) and slide it down over the servo. The tabs are sized so it will only go on one way so if it doesn't go on easily, try it the other way around"
  - time: 4.2
    title: Keep the cable tidy
    description: "Wind the servo cable around the centre piece to keep it tidy. Looking from above it should be wound in a clockwise direction through the two holes on each side of the servo"
  - time: 5.9
    title: Add the base ends

  - time: 93.0
    title: Align the two base pieces
    description: "Take the two large base pieces and align them with the white part on top, making sure that the four screw holes are properly aligned. These parts are not symmetrical so it is important to get them the right way around"
  - time: 97.2
    title: Attach the HAT to the Pi
    description: "Gently attach the Pi HAT to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi, making sure they align properly. Push down gently but stop before it is fully on to leave room for the spacers. At this point it's also worth setting up the SD card for the Pi so it's easier to get in. You can download the latest image from <a href=\"http://downloads.mime.co.uk/MeArmPi-latest\">here</a> (or <a href=\"http://downloads.mime.co.uk/MeArmPiZero-latest\">here</a> for the Pi Zero W) and follow <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/\">these instructions</a> to flash it."

  - time: 104.3
    title: Insert the front and back sides
    description: "Slot the front (part #24) and back (part #23) sides into place. If you have used a Pi Zero, then you should use part #25 instead of part #23 as you don't need the extra holes"
  - time: 106.8
    title: Insert the left side
    description: "Slot part #25 into place on the left of the base. If you're using a Pi Zero then there's an extra one of these to fill the gap on the right side of the base"
  - time: 108.6
    title: Attach the base cover
    description: "Slot all of the tabs on the edges into the cover and attach an elastic on either side of the base"
  - time: 111.8
    title: Attach the joystick caps
    description: "Push the joystick caps on to the joysticks. It's best to take a look at these and get them aligned properly because there are two flat sides that need aligning"
  - time: 113.9
    title: Slide the arm on to the base
    description: "Gently prise the two base plates apart and slide the servo arm in between them and slide it down the central slot until it clips into place in the hole in the bottom"

  - time: 120.0
    title: Attach the main cable
    description: "Plug the two parts together using the ribbon cable included. You're now ready to power up and use your MeArm Pi! First, plug in your power supply to the upper USB socket (the one on the HAT). The power supply should be capable of supplying 2.5A, like the official Raspberry Pi supplies. Once it's moved into its default position you can get started with <a href=\"../getting-started-with-the-mearm-pi/\">the instructions here</a> or just use the joysticks to control it. If it's having trouble moving then check <a href=\"../troubleshooting-the-mearm-pi/\">the troubleshooting guide</a> for help."
