videosteps:
  - time: 0.1
    title: Fit the right stepper into the base
    description: "Take the base and position as shown and then fit one of the stepper motors into the slot on the side"
  - time: 2.35
    title: Slot on the right side
    description: "Slot one of the side plates on and clip it forward into place"
  - time: 5.4
    title: Attach the right wheel
    description: "Carefully push one of the wheels on to the axle of the stepper motor, taking care to align the flat sides of the hole with the flat faces of the axle. It works best to push this on close to the centre"
  - time: 7.2
    title: Fit the left stepper motor
    description: "Fit the second stepper motor into place on the other side of the base"
  - time: 10.5
    title: Add the left side
    description: "Slot the second side plate over the motor and slide it forward so it clips into place"
  - time: 13.5
    title: Fit the left wheel
    description: "Push on the remaining wheel over the axle of the stepper motor"
  - time: 15.4
    title: Attach the rear base
    description: "Slide the rear base into place. It should slot into the two side pieces you just added. Make sure it goes on straight otherwise it can jam and break. It shouldn't need forcing"
  - time: 18.0
    title: Slide in the battery holder back
    description: "Slide down the battery holder back piece through the slots in the main base and into the slots in the rear base"
  - time: 20.0
    title: Clip in the rear wheel
    description: "Take the rear caster wheel and clip it up through the centre hole in the rear base piece"
  - time: 21.8
    title: Slide on the left wheel cover
    description: "Take one of the wheel covers with the 'M' logo cut into it and slide it back so that it clips into the slots on the rear base piece"
  - time: 24.5
    title: Slide on the right wheel cover
    description: "Repeat the previous step, sliding the right wheel cover on over the wheel"
  - time: 29.0
    title: Attach the PCB
    description: "Push the top of the PCB (the part with the two rectangular holes) into the slot along the front of the base and push it forward so that it slots onto the tabs in the slot"
  - time: 32.0
    title: Attach the crossbrace
    description: "Slide the crossbrace down so that it clips on the wheel covers and locks the PCB into place. Don't force this part - if it's not going on easily, just make sure all of the parts are well aligned so that one of them isn't catching"
  - time: 34.7
    title: Fit the elastic band to the servo mount
    description: "Hook one of the elastic bands over the servo mount"
  - time: 37.3
    title: Attach the servo
    description: "Slot the servo in to the servo mount as shown and then clip the elastic band over the top to hold it in place"
  - time: 39.0
    title: Tidy the stepper cables
    description: "Wind the cables for one of the stepper motors around the cable tidies underneath the Mirobot. It's worth taking care doing this and making sure they won't drag or obstruct the pen arm. The wire should go around the outer hook on its side first, then loop around the inner hook on the opposite side before looping back over the inner hook on its own side and plugging in to the stepper socket on the PCB"
  - time: 43.0
    title: Tidy the stepper cables (part 2)
    description: "Repeat the previous step with the cable for the other stepper motor. Once done the cables should be nice and neat and out of the way."
  - time: 45.0
    title: Tidy the servo cable
    description: "Now tidy the cable for the servo. The cable should loop in a figure of 8 around the inner two hooks and then plug into the pins on the PCB, making sure the yellow cable aligns with the 'Y' mark on the PCB"
  - time: 46.6
    title: Building the Pen arm - attach the elastic band
    description: "Put the main body of the robot to one side for now. Take the rear pen arm piece and loop the elastic band through the holes as shown in the picture. Make sure you get this piece the right way around"
  - time: 49.0
    title: Attach the main pen arm lever
    description: "Align the main pen arm lever with the rear piece and hook the elastic bands over the top and bottom as shown"
  - time: 50.1
    title: Push in the pen arm braces
    description: "Take both of the pen arm braces and one-by-one push them in between the two levers so that the arm is held together"
  - time: 54.7
    title: Slot the pen arm in to position
    description: "With the two levers to the left, slot these in to the base at an angle and drop it in to position. You will need to gently push the servo to one side to allow it to move in and this will also stop it from falling out"
  - time: 58.0
    title: Fit the battery pack
    description: "Slot the battery cable through the hole in the rear base and drop it into position. You can wind the wire around the other wires and hooks underneath to ensure it is tidy before plugging it into the PCB. Your Mirobot is now ready for use!

## Tips for success:
 - Don't force any of the pieces into position. If something won't fit then it's probably not meant to so double-check it's in the correct position.
 
 - Due to the fact that Mirobot is mostly symmetrical, most of the pieces be fitted either way around. However, the pen arm and the main base pieces are not symmetrical so make sure you get these the same way around as in the pictures otherwise the robot will be flipped and the pen arm might not fit properly.
