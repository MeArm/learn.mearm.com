Attach the MeArm micro:bit Board to your MeArm base, using the screws provided. Push the plastic thumb caps down onto the joysticks firmly.

Plug in your BBC micro:bit (sold separately) into the socket on the MeArm micro:bit Board.

Attach a micro USB cable (sold separately) to the BBC micro:bit and drag and drop the [following hex code](http://downloads.mime.co.uk/MeArm/MeArm-microbit.hex) into the BBC micro:bit device using your PC, chromebook, or Mac (all sold separately).

Attach the servo motors provided to your MeArm Base Board, matching the Orange wire to the Y (or O on later boards). Connect the MeArm micro:bit Board and MeArm Base Board together using the 6 pin ribbon cable provided.

Power the MeArm micro:bit Board using a 2A+ 5V USB Power Supply or a 6V AA battery pack (both sold separately).

Your Servo Motors should spring to life as the BBC micro:bit is powered, defaulting to their 90 degree positions. Attach the following servo horns in the following positions.

This is the calibration of your servo motors completed. Use them as required in the [MeArm build instructions](https://learn.mime.co.uk/building-the-mearm).

Once your MeArm is complete you can explore our make code blocks, by either dragging and dropping the hex code you've downloaded into the browser at [makecode.microsoft.org](https://makecode.microsoft.org/#editor) or adding our package from [GitHub](https://github.com/MeArm/pxt-microbit-mearm).
