The link in this guide is for running a classic MeArm Maker Kit with a Raspberry Pi. We now have a standalone product specifically for the Raspberry Pi called the MeArm Pi. The MeArm Pi can be found on our website [here](https://shop.mime.co.uk/collections/frontpage/products/mearm-pi-mime-blue) and the instructions to build are available [here](http://learn.mime.co.uk/docs/building-the-mearm-pi/).

The MeArm should be fun to build and easy to control. We've spent a lot of time putting together instructions for building and controlling the MeArm. We advise that you work out and test how to control your Servo Motors before constructing your MeArm. It will save you time and frustration, and lessen the chance that your MeArm will just be something cool to sit on your shelf.

Setting up a MeArm with a Raspberry Pi is quite a simple task. We detail the process [here](https://mime.co.uk/blog/2016/01/26/mearm-on-the-raspberry-pi/)
