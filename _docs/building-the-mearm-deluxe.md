The MeArm should be fun to build and easy to control. We've spent a lot of time putting together instructions for building and controlling the MeArm. We advise that you work out and test how to control your Servo Motors before constructing your MeArm. It will save you time and frustration, and lessen the chance that your MeArm will just be something cool to sit on your shelf.

We’ve put together a step by step guide, complete with wire frame pictures to help you assemble the MeArm. Included is all the info you’ll need to set up your Brains Board (the MeArm controller of choice), get it powered and ready to play!

PLEASE NOTE 6V MAX on the Brains Board!
