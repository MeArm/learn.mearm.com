## Tips for success:
 - Don't overtighten the screws! Tightening them too much can damage the arm. The best way of tightening the screws is to screw them in until they stop the joint moving freely and then loosen them slightly until it moves with no friction.

 - Don't force any of the pieces into position. If something won't fit then it's probably not meant to. If a part is meant to go on a specific way around then it has been designed to only go on that way around. If it doesn't seem to fit correctly then try turning it around.

You can also view these instructions as a [pdf](/assets/mearm-instructions-web.pdf).

Click "Start" to get going - if you need to repeat a step you can press the "repeat" button or press "loop" to keep looping a step until you're ready to move on to the next.
