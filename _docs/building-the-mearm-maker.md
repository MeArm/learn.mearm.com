    title: Fit the servo into the Base PCB
    description: "Take the base PCB and place it face up (look for the word TOP to help) then insert the servo that has a double ended arm (there's only one of these) into the hole in the centre. It needs to go the right way around so align the servo arm with the circle on the board"

  - time: 93.0
    title: Align the two base pieces
    description: "Take the two large base pieces and align them with the white part on top, making sure that the four screw holes are properly aligned. These parts are not symmetrical so it is important to get them the right way around"

## Tips for success:
 - Don't overtighten the screws! Tightening them too much can damage the arm. The best way of tightening the screws is to screw them in until they stop the joint moving freely and then loosen them slightly until it moves with no friction.

 - Don't force any of the pieces into position. If something won't fit then it's probably not meant to. If a part is meant to go on a specific way around then it has been designed to only go on that way around. If it doesn't seem to fit correctly then try turning it around.

Click "Start" to get going - if you need to repeat a step you can press the "repeat" button or press "loop" to keep looping a step until you're ready to move on to the next.
